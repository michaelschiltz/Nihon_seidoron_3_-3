#### Homework

From session 2 on, small student groups will be assigned to introduce topics to be discussed. This may include both historical matter and/or their contemporary implications.
Students are expected to:
1. to participate in the course as a whole: doing the essential reading for each week’s topic, and coming prepared to question and intervene.
2. To provide written and oral comments.
3. To Research, write, present, and defend your argument and choice of topic to be discussed.
4. When presenting, students should go beyond the narrow content of the reading to be presented; develop an argument as a coherent whole, e.g. by focusing on theoretical issues. As the course material concentrates on the issue of understanding economic processes through history, being able to explain them (in Japanese) is key. 

#### How to read?

Undergraduate students often find it challenging to read scientific articles; and indeed, the format that characterizes scientific publications is quite different from what may have been familiar in highschool. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQ3R) is a digest of a comprehensive reading method called SQ3R; there also exists a [longer guide](https://www.ucc.vt.edu/academic_support/online_study_skills_workshops/SQ3R_improving_reading_comprehension.html). 

#### Grading System

Evaluation will be based on: reading notes, class discussions (other means of evaluation may be discussed with the students). There is no paper to be written; instead, students are asked to make ‘smart’, elaborate and interactive presentations (these are a *must*). They are responsible for putting the presented reading in context, and act as ‘moderator’ for the follow-up discussion.
Although all grading is characterized by an inherent opacity (if only for the simple reason that every presentation pertains to different material and a different session), here are some simple rules:

1. students presenting on several occasions will receive a higher grade
2. students making elaborate presentations (including audiovisual material, links to primary sources etc.) will be rewarded for the extra effort
3. showing that you mastered the readings by partaking actively in the discussions is a plus.

As this class is an example of [problem-based learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem-based_learning) and the ['flipped classroom'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom), it **strongly encourages and rewards participation**; vice versa, **it penalizes a passive or absent behavior**. Concretely, 80 percent of your grade is based on class discussion; the remaining 20 percent is reserved for presentations.

**Some basic rules: whereas attendance is considered crucial, merely being present in class is insufficient to pass. Active participation is prerequisite. Checking social media or constantly looking at your phone during class is discourageing and even disturbing for your peers, so should be avoided. This class demands a considerable degree of commitment; do not take this class if you are not motivated.**
